Creating a script to eventually deploy on my Synology NAS that will notify me via email when a file from a particular folder hits 60 days 
old from the time it was added to that folder.
This is to ensure I am not keeping large files for my clients longer than 2 months.
I will receive an email once this event has happened which will prompt me to contact my client to get approval to delete the file, that
way saving on space on my NAS
